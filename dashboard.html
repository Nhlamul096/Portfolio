        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>In this presentation we will focus on alcoholic beverage sales data from the years 2018- 2021 for multiple manufacturers. With this data set we will be conducting an analysis from which we will draw useful insight on trends and performance of the market, and provide a forecast on future sales. Our aim is to use these insights and predictions to ultimately provide useful recommendations for SAB as a manufacturer.</p>

      <h2>Sales Trends analysis</h2>

      <div class="card">
        <p>SAB has been the leading manufacturer throughout all the years in this data set.
          The second most performing manufacturer is Competitor C
          Competitor A and B alternate over the 4 years, with Competitor B taking the slight lead. 
          Others is the least performing manufacturer 
          Despite having lower overall sales than SAB, competitor C had the largest increase in sum of sales volume over the years, while SAB had the largest decrease. 
          </p>

          <p>From this graph we immediately see that SAB has an exponential lead in sales, with the pack size of 750ml contributing the most to that lead. 
            The pack sizes with the highest demand ranges from 340 -750ml with SAB being the most preferred manufacturer. 
            </p>

            <p>In the beer category SAB is the best performing manufacturer, having an extensive lead compared to all other competitors. 
              In the beyond beer category Competitor C is the leading manufacturer, followed by competitor A, closely followed by Competitor B, with SAB being the penultimate manufacturer and others being the least performing.
              </p>

            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <ul>
              <li> more effective marketing of products, we advise that SAB invest in the latest digital and social marketing trends, which include short-form content marketing, influencer collaborations and targeted advertising.</li> 
              <li>SAB should offer more customer engagement as a potential marketing strategy, examples include loyalty programs and personalized marketing strategies </li>
              <li>For effective product development we recommend that SAB should further diversify and innovate their product by means of developing new flavours, new premium or craft lines, more promotion of pre-mixed beverages and the making limited editions or collaborations</li>
             <li>In terms of distribution, we recommend that SAB should develop more partnerships with online retailers, optimize their supply chain through efficient logistical processes, expand further into the intracontinental market ( Africa), and strengthen their existing alliances and partnerships with distributors to ensure optimal shelf placement.</li>  

             <li> From our analysis we found that the highest performing product from SAB is beer, specifically pack size 750ml which comes in the bottle pack type, and this product made more sales than all other products combined. For SAB to capitalize on this market lead we recommend new aesthetic renovations to the packaging and labelling of the product as a way to visually persuade the customer into purchasing this product over the competitors offering. </li>
             <li>The data showed that SAB is underperforming in the box segment, and had no market share in the tetra and sachet segment.However, these segments only make a 1% of the total market share from our analysis, we recommend that SAB promote the products under the box pack type using the marketing strategies mentioned in the previous slide (content marketing, influencer collaborations,etc.). </li>
              <li>For SAB to penetrate the tetra and sachet segments, we suggest that they conduct thorough market research to evaluate the demographic and appeal which drive sales in this segment, and then introduce new products under this segment in a customer engaging manner. </li> 
            </ul>
